## About Palika 
Palika means municipality. In Nepal, there are two types of the municipality: Nagar palika and Gaun palika which means Urban Municipality and Rural Municipality. It is a local body that administers a population. A municipality is basically the response of the state government to the need for certain public services (i.e., waste disposal, police and fire protection, water supply, health services) in addition to what is available from the county or other local governments in the area.

## What does Palika do in Rahat ?

During an aid distribution program, Palika has some significant roles assigned to it. They are basically the managers of a project who is responsible for registering or approving the beneficiaries, adding FSPs, and approving vendors and mobilizers to the system. Although they canâ€™t add budgets to the system they can issue tokens in bulk, and create QR codes for the beneficiaries. They can view all the transactions happening in the pilot program real-time.
